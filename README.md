Event Man(ager)
===============

Your friendly manager of attendees at an event.


Development
===========

See the DEVELOPMENT.md file for more information about how to contribute.


Technological stack
===================

- [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) (plus some third-party modules) for the webApp
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) (plus [Angular UI](https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/)) for the eye-candy
- [Font Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) for even more cuteness
- [Tornado web](http://www.tornadoweb.org/) as web server
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) to store the data

The web part is incuded; you need to install Tornado, MongoDB and the pymongo module on your system (no configuration needed).
If you want to print labels using the _print\_label_ trigger, you may also need the pycups module.


Coding style and conventions
============================

It's enough to be consistent within the document you're editing.

I suggest four spaces instead of tabs for all the code: Python (**mandatory**), JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

Python code documented following the [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/) syntax.


Install and run
===============

Be sure to have a running MongoDB server, locally.

    wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
    sudo python get-pip.py
    sudo pip install tornado
    sudo pip install pymongo
    sudo pip install pycups # only needed if you want to print labels
    cd
    git clone https://github.com/raspibo/eventman
    cd eventman
    ./eventman_server.py --debug


Open browser and navigate to: http://localhost:5242/

If you store SSL key and certificate in the *ssl* directory (default names: eventman\_key.pem and eventman\_cert.pem), HTTPS will be used: https://localhost:5242/

Authentication
==============

By default, authentication is required; default username and password are *admin* and *eventman*. If you want to completely disable authentication, run the daemon with --authentication=off
